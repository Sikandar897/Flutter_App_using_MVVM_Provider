  this is how you will provide urls, well every proj have baseurl just like below and e.g for login its base url will be like that 
  this is just for understanding how you provide base url. in this project i am using thirdparty services so we will have different base urls got it?

static var baseUrl = 'https://facebook.com/api/';
static var loginUrl = '${baseUrl}login';

static var baseUrl = 'https://reqres.in';
static var loginUrl = '$baseUrl/api/login';
static var registerUrl = '$baseUrl/api/register';


}
